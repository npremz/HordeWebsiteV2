We worked on a case study that involved creating a website for Café Belga. The UX/UI design emphasized simplicity, responsiveness, and visual consistency.

Built on NextJS, the platform includes advanced features for managing a reservation system, upcoming event dates, and the menu of Café Belga's various products.
