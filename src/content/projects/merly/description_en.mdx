Merly Patrimoine is an independent wealth management firm supporting high-net-worth individuals and entrepreneurs in organizing, optimizing, and passing on their assets. Their fee-only model ensures complete objectivity in their advice, with no commissions on financial products.

We created a refined and sophisticated visual identity and logo, reflecting both their financial expertise and modern approach to wealth management. Beyond the logo, we designed a comprehensive website with an elegant and professional layout, featuring an interactive tax simulator and educational resources to guide their clients through their financial decisions.
