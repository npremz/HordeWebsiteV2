## What is a (really) fast website?

It's simple, you can test it on this site: it's a website that loads instantly, whether you're on a computer, tablet, or mobile, whether you're at the office or on the train with a weak 4G signal.

**The reality:** 60% of your traffic comes from mobile, often with an unstable connection. A site designed for these conditions means 60% of your visitors won't leave frustrated.

## Why it matters:

**Bounce rate:** A slow site means a visitor leaves as quickly as they arrived. The numbers speak for themselves: **53% of mobile users abandon a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load** (Google). Every second counts.

**User experience:** Every second of waiting in your purchase journey is an opportunity for your visitors to abandon or postpone, often never returning. A one-second delay can reduce conversions by 7%, and a site that loads in 5 seconds sees its bounce rate increase by 90% compared to a site that loads in 1 second.

Users perceive a slow site as less reliable, less professional. **47% of consumers expect loading in under 2 seconds.** Not meeting this expectation means losing their trust from the very first seconds.

**Organic search:** A high-performing site responds well to SEO mechanisms. Loading speed has been an official Google ranking factor since 2010. Sites in the top 3 results generally have loading times under 2 seconds. Easily gain positions in search engines.

**Digital footprint:** A lightweight and fast site runs even on the most modest devices. An optimized site can reduce its energy consumption by up to 70%. At a time when computer component prices are exploding with AI, we believe it's important to rethink optimization.

## The numbers speak for themselves:

Amazon calculated that **every 100ms of latency costs them 1% in sales**. Pinterest increased conversions by 15% by reducing wait time by 40%. Walmart saw conversions increase by 2% for every second gained.

**For an e-commerce site at €100K/month, 1 second gained = potentially €14K in additional annual revenue.**

### **The result?**

So you get it, a really fast site is better for everyone.

* **For you:** Easier to maintain, better SEO, users who don't face a technical wall.
* **For your users:** A smooth experience, a phone that doesn't overheat in 30 seconds of browsing, and a message received without friction.
* **For the digital environment:** Minimal server costs, a site that works on grandma's smartphone, and relaxed maintenance.
