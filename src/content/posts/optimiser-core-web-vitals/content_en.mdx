## Why Core Web Vitals are crucial in 2026

Google has been using Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor since 2021. In 2026, their importance has only grown. A site with good scores sees its organic traffic increase significantly.

The three main metrics are:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: display time of the largest visible element
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**: responsiveness to user interactions
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: visual stability of the page

## Optimizing LCP: the most visible element

LCP measures the time required to display the largest visible element in the viewport. The goal is to achieve less than 2.5 seconds.

### Optimization techniques

Here are the most effective actions to improve your LCP:
- Preload the hero image with `<link rel="preload">`
- Use WebP or AVIF format for images
- Implement a CDN to reduce latency
- Optimize Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Avoid blocking fonts with `font-display: swap`

### Code example

```html
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/hero.webp" fetchpriority="high">
```

## Improving INP: user responsiveness

INP replaced FID in 2024. This metric measures interaction latency throughout the entire visit, not just the first interaction.

### Best practices

For optimal INP (less than 200ms):
- Avoid long JavaScript tasks (>50ms)
- Use `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical operations
- Implement code splitting
- Defer non-essential scripts

## Stabilizing CLS: avoiding shifts

CLS measures unexpected movements of elements. A score below 0.1 is considered good.

### Main causes

Layout shifts are often caused by:
- Images without explicit dimensions
- Dynamic ads or embeds
- Fonts that change size on load
- Dynamically injected content

### Solution

Always specify width and height on your images:

```html
<img src="photo.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Description">
```

## Recommended measurement tools

To monitor your Core Web Vitals:
- **PageSpeed Insights**: one-time analysis
- **Search Console**: aggregated field data
- **Lighthouse**: detailed audits in development
- **Web Vitals Extension**: real-time measurement

## Conclusion

Optimizing Core Web Vitals requires a methodical approach. Start by measuring, identify priority issues, and implement fixes one by one. The gains in SEO and user experience are well worth the investment.
