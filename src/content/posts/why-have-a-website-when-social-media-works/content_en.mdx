## Your social media is doing well. So what?

You post regularly. Your followers are growing. You even have clients finding you through Instagram. So why bother with a website?

Because the better your social media works, the more you depend on it. And that dependency is controlled by someone else.

## The real problem: dependency

When social media is your only channel, every platform decision impacts you directly. Algorithm changes, new rules, moderation bugs. You just deal with it.

**What's happened recently:**

* Since early 2025, **over 10 million accounts have been disabled by Meta**. Often without explanation, often by mistake
* In December 2024, Instagram **removed the ability to follow hashtags**, the last reliable organic discovery mechanism
* **65% of creators lost visibility** after Instagram's latest update
* When the TikTok ban loomed in the United States, some businesses realized that **90 to 98% of their revenue** depended on it

Funktasy Inc., a Canadian company, had its **98,000-follower** Instagram account suspended for a month. No explanation. They only regained access after a national media outlet contacted Meta directly.

These aren't extreme cases. This is the normal functioning of a system where you have zero decision-making power.

## You control nothing

It's called **digital sharecropping**. You invest time, energy and money to build an audience... on someone else's land.

**What you don't control on social media:**

* **Who sees your content.** Organic reach on Facebook has dropped to **5.9%** (some studies say 2.6%). Instagram: **4%**, down 18% year-over-year. X: **3%**. If you have 1,000 followers, between 30 and 60 people actually see your posts
* **How your brand is presented.** Your content appears alongside ads, competitors and distractions. You control neither the context nor the experience
* **Your data.** Platforms collect your audience's data. Not you. You don't know precisely who your visitors are, what they're looking for, or how they behave
* **Your content's lifespan.** A social post lives for a few hours. A blog article has an average lifespan of **1.95 years**

Platforms deliberately reduce organic reach to push you toward paid advertising. The more you depend on them, the more leverage they have over you.

## What a website changes

A website is a space you own. No one can change the rules, limit your visibility, or suspend your access.

**You take back control over:**

* **Your image.** You decide the design, the message, the journey. No competing ads, no distractions. Just your brand, as you intended it
* **Your audience.** Through a contact form or newsletter, you build an email list that belongs to you. No algorithm between you and your contacts. At Social Media Marketing World 2025, when marketers were asked to choose between 10,000 social followers or 1,000 email subscribers, **not a single one chose social**
* **Your visibility.** Your site is discoverable on Google by people actively searching for what you offer. You're no longer subject to an algorithm deciding whether your content deserves to be shown
* **Your data.** You know who visits your site, where they come from, what interests them. It's your data, not Meta's

It's also a lever for your credibility. 84% of users find a business more credible with a dedicated website. 97% of B2B buyers will want to check your website before reaching out. A website signals to your audience that you're an established business, not just an account on a platform.

## The right balance: home base + amplifiers

It's not website **or** social media. It's understanding the role of each.

**Your website = your home base.** It's your territory. You control everything: the message, the experience, the data, the relationship with your visitors. It's where Google indexes you. It's where your content works for you for months, even years.

**Social media = your amplifiers.** They create connection, show your personality, amplify your message. But they drive traffic back to your base, not the other way around.

**The logic:** a social media follower should become a website visitor, then a contact on your email list. Because your website and your email list are the **only digital assets you truly own**.

## Take back control

If social media is your only channel, you're dependent on companies that owe you nothing. It works, until the day it doesn't.

A fast, well-designed website that ranks on Google is the foundation everything else builds on. It's what makes you independent.
